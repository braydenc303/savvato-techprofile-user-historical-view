This is the line you need to add to package.json when including your local changes as a dependency in another project (for instance, if you were changing this library and wanting to see the changes in dtim-mobile):

    "@savvato-software/savvato-techprofile-user-historical-view": "file:../savvato/src/angular/savvato-techprofile-user-historical-view/dist/savvato-techprofile-user-histo    rical-view/savvato-techprofile-user-historical-view-0.0.XX.tgz"

    Be sure to change the version number at the end, as appropriate.
